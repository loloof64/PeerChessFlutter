#### Building

1. Add file app_icon.ico in the folder #PROJECT_ROOT#/windows/runner/resources
2. Compile in Release mode
3. Add all these elements in a common folder :
   1. The folder #PROJECT_ROOT#//build/windows/runner/Release
   2. The following DLL files, from the folder C:/Windows/System32, into the folder Release, that you copied just before:
      * msvcp140.dll
      * vcruntime140.dll
      * vcruntime140_1.dll
   3. You can now zip the content of the Release folder, as it will be the content of the application.
